# XAI-in-Dental-Imaging

This repository accompanies the seminar paper *"XAI in Dental Imaging: A Review of Methods and Applications"* submitted at Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, Summer Semester 2025.

## Objective
The goal is to implement and compare three common XAI methods – Grad-CAM, LIME, and SHAP — on a public dental image dataset for caries detection.

Specifically:
- Evaluate ease of implementation
- Visualize and compare explanation outputs
- Optionally assess performance differences

## Dataset
This project uses the public [Dental Caries Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tahuuanh/tooth-decay-datasetraw) from Kaggle.

Due to Kaggle's terms, you must download the dataset yourself and place it in the `data/` folder.
